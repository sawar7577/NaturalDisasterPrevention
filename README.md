# NaturalDisasterPrevention

# idea for codefundo++

The challenge is to find better ways to save lives and minimise economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent and manage impact of natural disasters.  

The main idea is to use machine learning to monitor any changes in the data related to atmospheric properties and geographic properties like wind pressure, land slopes etc. For example changes in steep slopes in land could be an indication of landslides, or abrupt changes in wind pressure in an area may imply arrival of a tornado.


## Predicting formation of tornadoes

We will be taking the example of preventing and minimising damage caused by tornadoes. Take the example of town,
sensors can be installed in different parts of the town which will capture real time data regarding atmospheric pressure and wind speeds. High wind speeds and large differences in atmospheric pressure are associated with tornado formation. Following properties will be stored in a database for future utilisation. A machine learning algorithm will be made to run continuosly on remote server which will monitor changes in above mentioned datasets.
A correlation can be formed from the dataset regarding wind speeds, atmospheric pressure etc to tornado formation and its level using a machine learning algorithm. Further a relation between occurence of tornadoes and time of the year can be found out.
After some certain parameters(which relate to formation of tornadoes and storms) reach a certain threshold, an alert will be issued by the concerned authorities. 

## Impact to the people
Since an alert can be issued on the basis of above solution, the people can move and take shelter in safe areas in town or their house. Further a tornado warning can help people make appropriate descisions and measures.

## Feasibilty of the solution
The major part of the cost of the solution will be making and installing the required sensors in the city or town. Cost of buying a remote server and cloud space will add to the cost of the solution. The cost of maintaining the server and sensors won't be much.
